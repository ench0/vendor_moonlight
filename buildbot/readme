Copy all files to your source directory and run it instead of build/envsetup.sh

Has external script support for cherry-picks from gerrit, see picks.sh as a template which must be edited

To utilize crond:
Run through build.sh at minimum of once and set your desired crond runs with the generated configs. Copy moonlight-cronbuild.sh and generated configs to appropriate dir.

For multiple devices
rename build-config/edit variable for device in lowercase inside and set the same filename inside a renamed copy of moonlight-cronbuild. Can also use this method for normal building of multiple devices without using crond.
